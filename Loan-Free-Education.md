title: Loan Free Education

Initially proposed [here](https://loan-free-ed.neocities.org).

The thought process is to provide free education, but take a percentage of earnings from graduates to cover their fees.

I joked about a similar concept where “would you still go to university if the online lectures contained 30 second ads, and in-person tutorials started with ‘this tutorial is sponsored by XXX’” Ie a university funded by modern advertising.
