## Google analytics moved to API
- Moved logEvent from nextgreen to a custom Google api call behind api.hackernoon.com to avoid content blockers from ad-blocks.

## Townhall comments
- added a toggle in story settings to allow anyone to get auto approval on comments in that story.
- useful for AMAs as per Limarc.

## Merging archive stories into main collection
- Working on shifting the old archived stories into the main stories collection.
- will tidy up the DB and prevent errors down the line.

## Working with DALLE-2 alternatives
- Unsure of feasibility, not a lot of compute/expensive.
