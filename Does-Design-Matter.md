I'm not very good at making things look pretty, and CSS pisses me off to no end.

What intrigues me about making something on the internet is the **functionality**, and not so much how quirky I can make it look.

I'm very spontaneous - when I think of a cool idea for a project, I just want to make it without having to spend time tweaking the styles just enough to make it fit into the rest of the site's aesthetic.

[This is my site right now](https://torbet.co) and it's about the limit of my CSS capabilities. 

It's built with tailwind, so on all the posts I can slap in a `class="prose"` and we're good to go - which is all fine and dandy until I want to add a new page in a couple of months and have forgotten the hundreds of class names that I need to add! No, I need a single CSS file that just makes the HTML defaults look *not dogshit* and that I can apply to any and all subsequent pages. 

I threw together [this alternative](https://lite.torbet.co) in a couple of hours over the weekend, as you can see - there is very little styling, but it maintains most of the functionality.
